# Library Management System using C++ 
Collage Project

- Much of the functioning of a library could be automated using the available technologies.
- Instead of dealing with files (papers), the use of a good Database together with a proper front end would not only reduce the operating cost but also make the task of the Librarian easier. 
- The most important thing is that an automated system of this sort can be customized to suit the needs of the users and provide good service to them.
